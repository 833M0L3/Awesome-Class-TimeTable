A simple web app that displays next class and remaining time left for it. It also show all the subjects that are today or tomorrow (updated at 5 pm).

I was sick of going though the time table document (awfully structured  :tired_face:) every morning. Sometimes I had to search through my inbox for the document which is way more time consuming. So I came up with this idea because of which I can wake up at 8:55 and be at class by 9  :smirk:
